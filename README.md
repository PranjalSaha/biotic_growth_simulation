# biotic_growth_simulation

**THIS PROJECT IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

This project aims to simulate the growth of biotic colonies over time, modeling 
factors like nutrient availability, reproduction rates, and environmental 
conditions. The simulation is implemented in C++ and aims to provide an 
educational tool for understanding dynamics and growth patterns in a controlled 
environment.

The design process is underway for simulating bacterial breeds, but can be 
implemented for other species in the future.

## Aimed Features
### Dynamic growth modeling: 
Simulate how biotic colonies grow based on nutrient availability.
### Environmental factors: 
Adjust temperature, pH, and nutrient distribution to see how they affect 
growth.
### Data visualization: 
Graphs and visual output for understanding biotic population changes over 
time.

## Installation

### Linux

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/biotic-growth-simulation.git
   cd biotic-growth-simulation
   ```
### Windows

1. Download the repository in the desired location.
2. Run the install.bat file in the scripts directory.

Note : Make sure that python and g++ are added to you path variables.

## Usage 

1. Once any changes are made to the source files, run the build.bat script 
from the scripts directory.
2. To run the simulation and save graphs, run.bat file in the scripts directory.
