# biotic_growth_simulation

**THIS PROJECT IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

This project aims to simulate the growth of biotic colonies over time, modeling 
factors like nutrient availability, reproduction rates, and environmental 
conditions. The simulation is implemented in C++ and aims to provide an 
educational tool for understanding dynamics and growth patterns in a controlled 
environment.

The design process is underway for simulating bacterial breeds, but can be 
implemented for other species in the future.

## Aimed Features
### Dynamic growth modeling: 
Simulate how biotic colonies grow based on nutrient availability.
### Environmental factors: 
Adjust temperature, pH, and nutrient distribution to see how they affect 
growth.
### Data visualization: 
Graphs and visual output for understanding biotic population changes over 
time.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
